                                    <p>William Hill is a country mile ahead of its competitors when it comes to football
                                        betting coverage. Where other top bookies offer up to around 100 markets a
                                        match, William Hill routinely offers 200+ markets for matches in elite leagues.
                                        A variety of betting options is available for all but the most minor leagues,
                                        and it’s not unusual to find 50 or more betting markets available for a match in
                                        a third division European league.</p>
                                    <p>The number of tournaments covered by William Hill is also impressive. Over 150
                                        tournaments are listed on the tournaments page. These range from the staple
                                        elite European leagues down to lower division semi-professional leagues in minor
                                        football-playing nations like Australia.</p>

                                    <p>William Hill takes a low-key approach to football betting specials. This
                                        bookmaker doesn’t target specific matches and events for promotions. However, it
                                        offers a small selection of ongoing money-back specials and accumulator refunds
                                        for all matches and tournaments.</p>

                                    <p>William Hill’s odds could stand improvement. Odds are typically close to the
                                        industry averages, but it’s unusual to see this bookie offering the best price
                                        in a match or outright market. That said, William Hill’s breadth of coverage
                                        means it will often be the only big name bookie offering any prices at all on
                                        more obscure tournaments and football matches.</p>
