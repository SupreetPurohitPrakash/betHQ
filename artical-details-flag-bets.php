                                    <p>You can think of a free bet as an opportunity to place a bet without risk, and
                                        get paid out the net winnings on the bet if it wins.</p>

                                    <p>The difference between a free bet and a regular bet is that you don’t contribute
                                        the stake yourself, so the stake won’t be refunded to you along with your
                                        winnings if the bet wins. Thousands of pounds of free bets are available from
                                        reputable bookmakers online at any given time. Typically you qualify for a free
                                        bet when you first open a new account with a bookmaker.</p>

                                    <h2 class="heading-2">Why do bookies offer free bets?</h2>
                                    <p>Bookmakers use free bets to encourage people to sign up for their services and
                                        make a deposit into their account. In return for giving you something free up
                                        front, bookmakers hope that you’ll continue to bet with them in future.</p>
                                    <h2 class="heading-2">Is there a catch?</h2>
                                    <p>Usually there's something of a catch, although often you can still use free bets
                                        to your advantage. Some bookmakers make it very easy to claim free bets and may
                                        not even require that you deposit funds with them first. Other bookmakers may
                                        require that you use your free bet funds to place additional bets before they
                                        pay out any winnings.</p>
                                    <p>To qualify for a free bet with a bookmaker, you typically need to:</p>

                                        <li>register a valid payment method and make a deposit into your account</li>
                                        <li>use your funds to place a bet on a sports event – the value of this bet will
                                            usually determine how much money
